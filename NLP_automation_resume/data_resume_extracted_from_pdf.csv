Previous Notable Projects

Gas-fired Brew Kettle: As one of his first projects, Mr. Claire designed and himself fabricated an allstainless steel, triple walled brew kettle for a small microbrewery. Fired with three 500,000 BTU open flame
natural gas burners, the 1,500 gallon kettle reaches optimal boil in 45 minutes. At that point, thermal sensors
trigger the burner and damper control systems to adjust automatically, allowing reduced BTU output and
slowing of the exhaust gases for maintenance of the optimal boil. Heat recovery coils were placed in the flue
gas path for heating facility water supplies, extracting as much remaining energy as possible from the burn.
This kettle is still in use after twenty-seven years and is producing over 500,000 gallons of product annually.
Heat Treating Chamber: Working with design criteria and clienta€™s engineers, a 5,400 cubic foot heat
treating oven for honeycomb core carbon fiber sheets and high gloss flat sheet products was designed and
fabricated from high temperature stainless steel and installed in the clienta€™s facility. The chamber,
approximately 15 feet wide, 20 feet deep, and 18 feet high, had a 8 inch thick pressurized water jacket
circulating more than 12,000 gallons of treated water at 100 pounds per square inch, and a hydraulically
operated door weighing in excess of 15 tons. The internal atmosphere of pure argon was heated to
temperatures exceeding 2,200 degrees during the heat-treating process.

Extrusion Punching Fixture: To update one of his employera€™s outdated manufacturing processes for
punching their custom extruded materials, Mr. Claire designed and himself fabricated custom tooling and
fixturing for punching precision progressive hole patterns in aluminum extrusions. The design process
consumed nearly 4 months, and manufacturing another 3 months, and the resulting modular fixture accepted
15 different shaped extrusions and punched a maximum of 6 different hole sizes and patterns, with 4 spacing
options within each pattern, per extruded shape. This fixture allowed for consolidation of multiple operations,
which previously had been done in several steps in multiple machines, into one streamlined process using
only one of the companya€™s existing machines instead of six, while at the same time creating flexibility for
new extruded shapes. By eliminating out-of-tolerance issues created by multiple handlings of the same piece,
which frequently occurred with the older processes, scrapped material was reduced by nearly 60%.
Additionally, setup times decreased by 80% by utilizing a series of electro-pneumatic mechanisms which the
operator controlled with a series of selector switches that determined the shape, pattern, and spacing being
punched. After being loaded onto the in-feed rollers, the lengths of materials were automatically fed through

the fixture for punching once the cycle had been initiated by the operator.

When thinking of the timeline of my career, numerous bullet points come to mind.
Whether it be a skill or achievement that I can bring to the table, there is one common
denominator that all of these personal traits fall under: Teamwork. Regardless of what
job I may have had in the past, whether it be music education, recruiting, or sales,
understanding that I am existing within/leading a team allows me to clearly understand
the task at hand. Communication is the number one element to a successful team. A
prolonged lack of communication can manifest itself into a negative environment, and

it has been my number one priority to make sure everyone involved is on the same

page.

description of an inside sales representative at DAR since it is a small family

CORE ACCOMPLISHMENTS

With the unique combination of working as a consultant in both the business and
clinical areas of health care, Jessica has worked tirelessly to achieve the highest
levels of client satisfaction and outcomes through comprehensive client care,
team development, educational training and delivery and telemedicine support
programs.

As a consultant for HELP Pain Medical Network, Jessica developed and
implemented their Remote Care Services Program.

Rehabilitation Program (IPRP) fostered individual empowerment and
independence by teaching and reinforcing principals learned in the IPRP.

As a result in the Remote Care Services, clients were able to reduce and manage
pain, reduce dependence on pain medication, increase their overall health
perception and prevent relapse.

Jessica's work with HELP focused primarily on Workers Compensation clients.
She worked extensively in the coordination of multiple carriers, applicant
attorneys, patients and primary care providers to achieve positive outcomes for
both the patient and the carrier.

As Vice President of Operations for HELP, Jessica continued to work with
physicians and other providers, patients and carriers to develop an IT
infrastructure to efficiently navigate the rapidly changing California Workers
Compensation revisions.

code (Python/Java/Perl) to fix security vulnerabilities, developing new web application features, managing
100+ terabytes production and research data, maintaining 30+ physical and virtual servers to facilitate
production and research, and developing software to improve web crawling, information classification and
extraction.

e By the end of 2014, I was able to run the entire search engine single handed.

e In 2015, I proposed infrastructure and software solutions to overcome scalability bottlenecks and blueprinted
the next generation of CiteSeerX.

e By the end of 2016, I had scaled the data collection from 3 million to over 10 million documents.

e Currently, the system can keep running for several months without major issues.

CAD were highly implemented to simulate different geometries inside a wind
tunnel.

¢ Pressures, temperatures, velocities among other important physical quantities
were analyzed in 40 different geometries.

¢ This project contributed with the optimization process of turbine blades and
aided them to achieve higher temperature levels and efficiency.

e tis not a secret in today's industry that turbine engines are able to produce
extremely high inlet temperatures when they implement cooling impingement,
which allow them to cool down the system without harming the performance of
the engine.

¢ Also, it allows the engine to achieve higher efficiency levels.

e Upon this experiment, a research paper was written and patented.
