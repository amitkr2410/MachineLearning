#Here, we apply statistical methods to understand features/correlations present in the data

Regression models: \
(1) Random Forest decision tree \
(2) Support vector Machine- SVM \
    Introduction to SVM (Supervised machine learning technique) \
    Useful for classification, Regression, Outlier/Anomaly detection \
    Relevant Library to Import \
    Modeling Cancer data \

(3) CNNTensorFlow- Deep learning \
