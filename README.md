#Here, we apply statistical methods to understand features/correlations present in the data

## Regression models: \
## (1) MultiProjectRegressionModel \
    In this project, we do exploratry study of the data \
    Things to check are shape/size of data, nulls for missing values, types of coloumns \
    Use sci-kit library's SimpleImputer and OneHotEncoder to do preprocessing of the data \
    Perform analysis to look for a trend in the data \
    Build Linear or polynomial regression model on the training data
    
(2) Random Forest decision tree \

(3) Support vector Machine- SVM \
    Introduction to SVM (Supervised machine learning technique) \
    Useful for classification, Regression, Outlier/Anomaly detection \
    Relevant Library to Import \
    Modeling Cancer data \

(4) CNNTensorFlow- Deep learning \
    Classify brain tumor 2D scanned images into tumorus or healthy sample using Convolutional neural network

(5) WebScrappingBS4  \
   We use python library called "BeautifulSoup" to do webscrapping. In the end we use seaborn library to make a bar graph.
