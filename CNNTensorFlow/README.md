#Our goal is to apply deep learning convolutional neural network \
alogirthm and build a model that allows us to classify brain tumor \
CT scanned images into healthy or tumorous sample.

#We use keras library and train the model using Sequential method. \
The original images of brain are converted into a matrix data using function "ImageDataGenerator" defined in keras library.

(1) Using custom build CNN architecture

(2) Using ResNet50 CNN architecture


Our custom build CNN architecture outperforms ResNet50 model predictions.
