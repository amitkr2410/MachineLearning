### Our goal is to apply deep learning convolutional neural network algorithm and build a model that allows us to classify brain tumor CT scanned images into healthy or tumorous sample.

We use keras library and train the model using Sequential method. \
The original images of brain are converted into a matrix data using function "ImageDataGenerator" defined in keras library.

Our custom build CNN architecture outperforms ResNet50 model predictions.
